3 things that I am very proud of this School Year:

I started working my first job at Stop and Shop this past November and so far it has been great. The work environment is exquisite and I don't mind talking to Old Ladies about "keeping the bag light"

Having a close family is what really supported me throughout this year. If it weren't for them, this Senior Year would have been less bearable. 

I'm grateful for having a tight knit group of friends this year. Hopefully I get to see them throughout our own experiences in college
